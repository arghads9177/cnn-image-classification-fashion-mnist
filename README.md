# **Image Classification with Fashion-MNIST Dataset**

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on developing a robust image classification model using the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, which is designed as a more challenging alternative to the classic MNIST dataset. The dataset contains grayscale images of various fashion items, categorized into 10 distinct classes.

## About the Dataset  

### Dataset Description  
The **Fashion-MNIST dataset** consists of:  
- **Training Set:** 60,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels).  
- **Test Set:** 10,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels).  
- **Classes:** 10 fashion categories, completely mutually exclusive.  

Each image is labeled with one of the following 10 classes:  
| Label | Class Name         | Description                                   |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 0     | T-shirt/top        | Upper-body garment without buttons or collar |
| 1     | Trouser            | Pants or slacks                              |
| 2     | Pullover           | Sweater or knitted garment                   |
| 3     | Dress              | One-piece garment                            |
| 4     | Coat               | Outerwear worn for warmth                    |
| 5     | Sandal             | Open-toe footwear                            |
| 6     | Shirt              | Upper-body garment with buttons              |
| 7     | Sneaker            | Sports shoes                                 |
| 8     | Bag                | Carrying accessory                           |
| 9     | Ankle boot         | Footwear covering the ankle                  |  

### Dataset Highlights  
- **Image Size:** 28x28 pixels in grayscale (1 channel).  
- **Structure:** Same training/testing splits as MNIST, making it a drop-in replacement.  
- **Challenge:** Unlike handwritten digits in MNIST, these fashion items have more intricate details and variability.
